# week 2 

Materials for the codelab session were inspired by and almost the same as Andrew Ng's <a href="http://ml-class.org">ml-class</a><br/>

There is one ipython notebook file 'Linear regression with one variable.ipnb' and three python files. The task is to complete codes in the python files to get expected result in the notebook.

To start, launch jupyter notebook and open the notebook file.
